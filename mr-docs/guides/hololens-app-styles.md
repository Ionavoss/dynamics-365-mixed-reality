# Use a style to add emphasis to a hologram in the Guides HoloLens app

You can add styles in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app to provide visual cues for your holograms. For example, add the **Warning** style to indicate caution or the **Red** style to make sure that an operator doesn't do something that could cause harm. As your operators get used to the visual language that styles provide, their learning process speeds up.

## Add a style

1. Select a hologram that you've already placed in the real world.

1. Select the **Edit Hologram** (pencil) button.

1. Select **Styles**.

    > [!TIP]
    > On HoloLens 2, you can select the **Styles** command and subsequent menu items directly with your finger. For more information about manipulating holograms in HoloLens 2, see [Authoring and navigating gestures for HoloLens 2](authoring-gestures-HL2.md).

1. Select the style that you want to use.

The styles available in Guides and when to use them include:

| Style | Purpose | How it appears to the operator |
|---|---|---|
| Original | Restore the original appearance. | Default appearance |
| Red | Show areas or things to avoid. | Red flashing |
| Green | Show areas or things to approach. | Green flashing |
| Caution | Warn about a safety or quality concern. | Yellow and black stripes |
| X-ray | Show things that occur inside something. | A pulse that appears through it |
| Outline | Tell the operator to pick something up. | Outline |
| Dashed outline | Show the operator where to place something. | Dotted line |
| Obscure | Cover sensitive objects to block the operator's view. | 90% bright white |
| Pass-through | Cut through holograms to see the real world behind them. | TBD |
| Metallic | Provide a realistic metal finish for an object. | Metallic |
| 50% transparent | TBD | 50% transparent |
| 75% transparent | TBD | 75% transparent |

## Best practices for styles

- Use styles to reinforce actions.

- Use styles only for the purpose that they were intended for. After operators learn the visual language of styles, they'll know that a particular style means a specific thing, which speeds up their learning process.
