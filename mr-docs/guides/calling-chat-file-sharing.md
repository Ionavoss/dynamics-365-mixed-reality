# Start a chat in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens 

When you're on a call in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens, you can chat with one or more remote collaborators on Microsoft Teams desktop or Microsoft Teams mobile. A remote collaborator on the call can share files or links with you in the Chat window. This is particularly useful in service-related scenarios where the remote expert wants to share a diagram or some other illustration to help you diagnose and/or solve a problem.

## Start a chat

1. If you receive a chat message while you're on a call, a red circle appears on the **Chat** button, and the **Chat** button animates. Select the **Chat** button to open the chat.
