# Start a chat in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens 

When you're on a call in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens, you can chat with one or more remote collaborators on Microsoft Teams desktop or Microsoft Teams mobile. A remote collaborator on the call can share files or links with you in the Chat window. This is particularly useful in service-related scenarios where the remote expert wants to share a diagram or some other illustration to help you diagnose and/or solve a problem.

## Start a chat

1. If you receive a chat message while you're on a call, a red circle appears on the **Chat** button, and the **Chat** button animates. Select the **Chat** button to open the chat.

    A new Chat window appears to the right of the Meetings window.     
    
2. To respond to the chat, place your gaze cursor over the box that says "Type a new message".

3. In the holographic keyboard that appears, enter your message or use the microphone button to dictate a message. Select the **Send** button (or press the Return key on the holographic keyboard) when you're ready to send the message.

4. If a remote expert on the call shares a file or sends a web link in the Chat window, select the link to open the file or page.

   The file or page opens in a new window. You can move this window wherever you want or size it directly with your hands. 
   

???Can the HL user initiate a chat or just receive a chat???
