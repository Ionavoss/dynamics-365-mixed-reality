# Interact with holograms in the Guides HoloLens app

If an author has made an object interactable, a hand icon shows in the middle of the object. You can explore the object in the Guides HoloLens app using natural hand gestures.

- To grab a hologram near you, pinch your thumb and index finger together on the hologram and hold. Use this grab gesture to move, resize, and rotate. To let go, release your fingers.

- To resize a hologram, use both hands to pinch the hologram and stretch your hands apart to make it larger or move your hands together to make it smaller.

- To quickly move the hologram back to its original authored state and position, press the circular arrow just above the hand icon. Say "Guides, Reset Step" to move all objects back to their starting positions.

- To understand how parts fit together, move the object to the correct placement. A green dashed line appears when you are close to the correct spot. In some cases, a lightly visible or ghost outline of the part shows its original placement.
