# Enable operators to interact with holograms in the Guides HoloLens app

If you added a 3D part in your guide that you would like operators to explore, you can place that part in the real world using the HoloLens app, then set it to be interactable.

## Set the 3D part to be interactable

1. Air tap the hologram that you've already [placed in the real world](hololens-app-place-holograms.md) to select it.

1. Air tap the **Edit Hologram** (pencil) button.

1. Select **Interactable**.
