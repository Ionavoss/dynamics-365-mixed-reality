# Enable operators to interact with holograms in the Guides HoloLens app

If you want operators to explore a 3D part, you can place that part in the real world using the HoloLens app, then set it to be interactable. For example, you want an operator to learn how a 3D part fits with other parts. You can place several parts and align them next to each other and make each one interactable. Operators will see each part as interactable and be able to disassemble the equipment and reassemble it.

## Set a 3D part as interactable

1. [Place the 3D object in the real world](hololens-app-place-holograms.md)

1. Air tap the hologram to select it and then air tap the **Edit Hologram** (pencil) button.

1. Select **Interactable**.

1. Toggle on **Interactable**.

1. To provide the operator with a hint for putting the object back in the correct position, toggle on **Interactable Ghost**. Operators will see a green dashed outline of the 3D part's correct placement.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The **Interactable Ghost** option increases the complexity of the step. To learn more about reducing complexity, see [Optimize your 3D models to use with Guides and Power Apps](/3d-content-guidelines/optimize-models).
