# View calling information stored by Dynamics 365 Guides

When Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides users make or receive calls in the HoloLens app, call information is stored in Microsoft Dataverse. Anyone who has access to make.powerapps.com or the Guides environment can view their own data in the Guides model-driven app. Users can view only their own data; administrators can view data from all users. 

Location data is only stored in Microsoft Dataverse if the user consents to store that data. Users are prompted to provide permission to store location data when they start the HoloLens app for the first time, but they're not required to store location data to use the HoloLens app. Location is only used for calling tasks in Dynamics 365 Guides.
