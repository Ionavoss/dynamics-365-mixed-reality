# Work with annotations in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens

If you're using Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens, and you're on a call with a remote collaborator using Teams desktop or Teams mobile, you and the remote collaborator can both annotate your shared environment. Annotations are useful for pointing out different parts of your space, including parts that may be difficult or dangerous to reach. All call participants can see each othersâ€™ additions, and can make annotations of their own. Once an annotation is placed, it will remain anchored in your space until the person who placed the annotation deletes it. Adding annotations to files works the same way.

At this time, a HoloLens user can draw in their environment but can't place arrows. The remote expert on Teams desktop or Teams mobile can draw **and** place arrows.

Any user on Teams desktop, Teams Mac, or Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile can annotate the environment of the Dynamics 365 Guides user on HoloLens. Teams mobile users can only annotate in one-to-one calls, however, not group calls. Annotations are not supported for users on Teams Web. 

> [!NOTE]
> To use annotations, you must enable the appropriate permissions in Dynamics 365 Guides. [Learn more](hololens-app-permissions.md)

## Draw in your space

> [!NOTE]
> Annotations don't work well on black or reflective surfaces.

1. Select the **Ink** tool on the **Annotate** toolbar.

2. Use your hand ray to place the cursor where you want to start drawing.

    > [!NOTE
    > If hand rays are turned off in the HoloLens app, they're automatically turned back on again when you select the **Ink** tool.

3. Air tap, keep your index finger and thumb together, and start drawing in your space. Release the air tap to stop drawing. 

    > [TIP]
    > To use a voice command, select the **Ink** tool by saying "Guides, Ink." Then say "Guides, Start inking" and "Guides, Stop inking" to start and stop inking.

## Change ink color

- Select the **Color** tool on the **Annotate** toolbar, and then select the color you want. The next drawing that you do will be that color.

???Should we add the PV camera render content from the RA topic???
