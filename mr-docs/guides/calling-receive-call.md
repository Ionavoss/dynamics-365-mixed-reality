# Receive a call in Teams from a Dynamics 365 Guides user

To receive a call from a Dynamics 365 Guides user, you must use Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't call a Dynamics 365 Guides user from Teams. The Dynamics 365 Guides user must initiate the call.

## Receive a call in Teams desktop (PC or Mac) from a Guides user

1. Launch the Teams app.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If this is the first time you have launched Teams and you have not been invited to any other teams, Teams automatically takes you to the correct place. If you have been invited to other teams, you might need to switch to the appropriate organization.  
   >
   > To switch organizations, in the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the window, select the appropriate guest organization. Teams might take a few seconds to reload.

1. When you see an incoming call notification at the bottom right side of your screen, select **Audio** or **Video** to join the call.

1. Use the Teams desktop call controls.
