# Known issues with the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

## Remote participant's status in a call or meeting incorrectly shows "Calling" even after they join

The status of a remote participant on the Participants List may not update if that user is invited to join a call or meeting by a Guides HoloLens user. The user can hear, see video, and speak despite the incorrect status of "Calling". However, the Guides HoloLens user can't switch to their video, mute, or remove the user.

## Guest users can't send or receive chat messages while in a group meeting

If you [invite a guest user](admin-add-guest-user.md) to a [meeting](calling-meetings.md), the guest is unable to send or receive chat messages in the meeting. Guest users can chat in one-to-one calls, but not in meetings.

## Guide doesn't go to the next step when you rapidly air tap the Next button

If you open a guide in operator mode and rapidly air tap the **Next** button, the guide may appear stuck and doesn't go to the next step. To restore navigation, stop air tapping until any animation has finished, and then air tap a single time.

## The “Call From” and “Call To” fields are blank when viewing records in the Phone Calls table

These fields are blank by design. The Phone Calls table is a common table used by Dynamics 365 apps to record phone call information. Dynamics 365 Guides and Dynamics 365 Remote Assist do not collect or populate these fields. [Learn more about viewing and accessing call data](call-logging.md)

## Why did my HoloLens display go blank for a few seconds when I placed a 3D model in the HoloLens app?

If you place a large 3D model in the HoloLens app, the display may go blank for several seconds while the model is being processed by Dynamics 365 Guides.

## Why isn't my operator sessions data being saved to Microsoft Dataverse? 

We recently identified an issue with an update where Dynamics 365 Guides operator sessions data (for both authors and operators) aren't saved to Microsoft Dataverse. Users may notice that session data was not being recorded as early as October 15, depending on region.

This issue doesn’t affect the ability to operate a guide, but it does affect all Guides customers who [analyze their guide session data](analytics-overview.md) or use the StepEnd event for integrations. 

A fix will be deployed to all customers during the week of December 6, 2021, during regional maintenance hours. There is no action required to receive the fix. Additionally, Microsoft is updating the Dynamics 365 Guides 7.0 HoloLens app with a hotfix on December 2, 2021, to enable customers to begin saving sessions data before the general fix is ready. To apply this fix, see [Update your solution](upgrade.md).

If you have any questions, contact Microsoft Support.

## Telemetry data not stored for operators with **Restricted Operator** role in certain cases

Operators with the **Restricted Operator** role that don't have the appendTo privilege can access and operate guides but their session data (telemetry) is not stored for time-tracking purposes.

## When you place large assets on HoloLens, you might experience minor loading delays

The [!include[pn-hololens](../includes/pn-hololens.md)] app currently loads the guide right after you open it. As you use the guide, the app loads it in the background. If your guide contains large 3D models and media, you might experience loading delays of a few seconds.

## An incorrect profile picture shows in the app 

If an incorrect profile picture displays, make sure that you're signed in. Select the profile picture, sign out, and then sign back in by using your [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)] credentials. Your profile picture should appear correctly.

By using the correct credentials to sign in, you ensure that your work progress is correctly tracked in [!include[pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-dyn-365.md)].

## The video preview on a step is blurry

The PC app video may appear to be blurry when an author previews a video in the HoloLens app. The PC app converts and resizes videos when they're uploaded to ensure optimal performance on HoloLens. This transcoding process depends on the codecs installed on the PC and errors can occur if codecs are removed from the PC. The  HoloLens app currently uses an optimized video specification of 853×480 H.264. If your video is recorded at a very high resolution, or if it's very large, the transcoding process on the PC might degrade the quality, making it appear blurry. To fix this issue, record and upload a new video, keeping its length and resolution in mind. Only the 853x480 video file is stored on Microsoft Dataverse.

## When the see-through style is applied to a 3D model, it might show gray areas instead of correctly rendering textures 

There are rendering issues for the "see through" style on some 3D models. Some surfaces on these models will look gray. If you experience this issue, use another style. If you **must** use this style and need help with it, contact customer service.
