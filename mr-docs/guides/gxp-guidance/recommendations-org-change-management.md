# Recommendations for Organizational Change Management

Implementing and adopting mixed reality in organizations requires strong orchestrating efforts. New hardware, new software, and new ways of working must be addressed, managed, and governed through controlled processes and well-executed Organizational Change Management (OCM).

OCM is an important part of your implementation process because it helps to ensure that Guides is effectively adopted and integrated into your organization: If your operators do not take advantage of guides for training and job instruction in their daily work life at the production sites, HoloLens and Guides won't provide any organizational benefits despite being technically implemented in an industry compliant way.

To foster organizational adoption and ensure buy-in from departments, managers, training consultants, operators, and others, we recommend four activities inspired by [Prosci's ADKAR® model](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar):

1. **Formulate a change vision**

   Make it crystal clear the purpose of implementing Guides and to which desired state you plan to steer your organization. This is called a change vision. On a strategic level, a change vision helps you ensure that the purpose of your Guides implementation is in line with your company's overall strategy and future goals.  
  
   A generic example of a change vision statement is: "We leverage Guides to enhance the quality and efficiency of operator training while maintaining strict compliance with industry regulations, empowering our workforce to continuously improve their skills and contribute to the success of the organization."

   We recommend involving representatives from different organizational stakeholder groups in the change vision creation by facilitating a series of workshops. By bringing in different stakeholder perspectives, your change vision naturally becomes more well-rounded. And because of their involvement, you increase the chances that stakeholders are invested in the vision, support it, and take accountability for their part in making the vision a reality.

1. **Assess site or area maturity**

   When implementing Guides, it is important to assess if the production site or area in question is ready for roll-out. For this purpose, it is recommended to, among other things:

   - Establish a use case selection process to make sure that the training and job instruction processes in question are relevant to support via Guides.

     > [!TIP]
     > Processes that are complex (involving multiple steps, for instance), rare (and thereby difficult to remember), difficult (because they tend to cause deviations), and prone to frequent onboarding of new operators (due to high staff turnover, for instance) are usually relevant.

   - Make a list of local requirements needed to succeed with Guides adoption, including but not limited to the following requirements: management approval, allocated resources for adoption, finalized role distribution (for example, who will be authors?), and site acceptance of a planned adoption timeline.

1. **Prepare for onboarding of areas/sites and onboard them**

   When one or more sites or areas are considered mature enough for a Guides adoption, to help prepare for the actual onboarding of sites or areas:

   - Map and analyze stakeholders to identify potential roadblocks, assess the level of support or resistance to the adoption process, and tailor communication and engagement strategies to meet the needs of the specific stakeholder group.

   When onboarding sites:

   - Utilize a similar onboarding plan across areas/sites with a clear division of responsibility and roles to ensure coherent and adequate onboarding.

   - Equip sites/areas with adoption and training "packages", consisting of, for instance: Guides' instructions for end-users (role-based), scripts and templates for workshops/meetings/emails (to the local project team), and executive summaries (for local management).

   - Ensure standardized Guides training, that is continuously updated based on learnings and improvements across all sites.

   - Define and deploy a "train the trainer" concept to scale the standardized Guides training through local "ambassadors". An important success criterion for the concept is the empowerment of frontline workers – are they capable of authoring and operating guides because of the training?

1. **Sustain adoption and secure benefit realization**

   As Guides are successfully rolled out to areas and sites, to help ensure the continued success of the software:

   - Create a process for rolling out changes such as new software features.

   - Develop area and site KPIs to track the performance of Guides.

   - Regularly distribute user satisfaction surveys and incorporate or respond to the feedback given.
