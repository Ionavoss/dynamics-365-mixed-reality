# Dynamics 365 Guides in regulated industries overview

Production companies within regulated industries such as life science, food science, medical devices, and cosmetics are increasingly looking into digital technology to optimize business processes. [Microsoft HoloLens](/hololens) (HoloLens) with the software [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides](../index.md) (Guides) is an excellent example of such digital technology.

However, complying with GxP protocols is not an easy task. It requires resources, expertise, training, and coordination among different teams and departments. It also poses significant challenges regarding efficiency, productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. For example, some of the common issues that pharmaceutical manufacturers face when following GxP protocols are human errors and inconsistencies, lack of visibility and collaboration, and inflexibility and inefficiency.

Mixed Reality (MR) can address the challenges. MR encompasses both Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) to create immersive and interactive experiences with digital overlays on the physical world or a simulated environment. MR can offer benefits for manufacturers in regulated industries who need to comply with GxP, such as:

- **Enhanced compliance**: Provide real-time guidance and feedback to human operators during the execution of tasks or procedures, ensuring that they follow the correct steps and comply with the quality standards. Capture and record data automatically during the process, reducing the need for manual documentation and increasing the accuracy and traceability of the records.
- **Improved quality**: Enable human operators to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively, reducing errors and waste, getting it right the first time is essential. Facilitate quality control and assurance by allowing operators to inspect products or equipment more efficiently and thoroughly using digital tools or simulations.
- **Reduced risk**: Help human operators to avoid or mitigate potential hazards or risks during the process, such as exposure to harmful substances or environments, with safety warnings or instructions. Enable remote assistance or collaboration among different teams or experts, reducing the need for physical presence or travel.
- **Increased productivity**: Increase the speed and throughput of the process by streamlining workflows and eliminating unnecessary steps or delays. Enable human operators to learn new skills or update their knowledge more quickly and effectively using interactive training modules or simulations.
- **Enhanced innovation**: Foster creativity and innovation by allowing human operators to experiment with different scenarios or solutions using digital prototypes or models. Enable human operators to access relevant information or insights more easily using contextual data or analytics.

Effectively replacing paper-based approaches, Guides uses [mixed reality](/training/modules/intro-to-mixed-reality) to train or instruct operators at a production line. Images, videos, and holographic 3D models are orchestrated into intuitive, three-dimensional guides showing operators what and where to do a task. As a result, production tasks are completed faster, with fewer errors, and with greater skill retention.

[Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/what-is-power-platform/) (Power Platform) can be used to set up the required governance for Guides, while helping you to technically scale and manage the life cycle of guides within your enterprise.

However, as these articles provide general guidance across regulated industries, always make sure to familiarize yourself with and follow your industry-specific regulations regardless of the advice in these articles.

The following GxP sections contain articles that introduce relevant considerations and recommendations for setting up a scalable governance structure using these tools. We hope that your journey to eliminate paper-based procedures, increase efficiency, and quality is easier managed.
