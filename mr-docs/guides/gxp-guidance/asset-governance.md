# Asset governance 

When authoring guides, apart from text, you'll use a range of assets to create intuitive and effective instructions. The assets fall into three categories:

1.  Self-produced assets, for instance, globally approved company logos, or a video in which a seasoned operator shows hand gesture best practices for machine operation.

2.  Externally produced assets such as an illustration or picture originating from a paper-based or digitized user manual produced by your company's machine supplier.

3.  Hybrid assets co-created by your organization and an external partner, for example, a supplier's drawing of a machine part that your organization uses as a basis for making a 3D CAD model of the same part.

Just like the authored guides at large, your organization will want the individual assets to be governed and compliant. This means that the rights to use the asset are in place and that the asset is always updated to the latest version. For this purpose, your organization will decide on, among other things, these questions:

-   Do you have the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to use the assets? This is particularly relevant for externally produced assets and hybrid assets. Tip: When procuring new machinery, make sure that your organization's rights of use also apply to machine drawings.

-   If you have the IPR: What are potential usage restrictions? Is location of usage limited to certain countries, regions, factories? Is the IPR limited in time?

-   In your organization, who will be assigned ownership of the asset (from a technical as well as practical point of view)?

-   How will you ensure that the asset owner is requested to 1) remove the asset from the content library (if usage rights are revoked), or 2) replace the uploaded asset with a newer version, for instance, if your company logo gets a graphic makeover? For externally produced assets and hybrid assets consider setting up a governance structure where your procurement section acts as a link between a supplier and your company's asset owner. In this context, it is important for asset owners to keep an overview of where their assets are used (in which guides) to be able to identify guides impacted by changes.

-   How will you ensure that guides authors are notified of removed/updated assets so that the author can revise guides accordingly? This will likely be solved by establishing a workflow between your asset owners and guides authors.

-   What naming conventions will support asset governance? Incorporating information such as asset type, expiration date, geo-restrictions etc. into the asset name will help asset owners and guides authors to handle the asset appropriately.

In the early stages of a Guides implementation, asset governance might seem redundant because it is likely that a project team is close to all processes. However, over time, as Guides usage scales throughout your organization and (parts of) machinery (including its manuals) become obsolete and replaced, maintaining assets will be difficult if asset governance has not been established. Most likely, utilizing an outdated asset in guides is non-compliant with your industry's (GxP) requirements.

## Platform qualification and app validations

A prerequisite for implementing Guides in regulated industries is that your organization 1) qualify the Power Platform 2) validate the Guides app, and 3) validate the Power Apps. The requirements for qualification and validation varies depending on industry. The following section is based on requirements for Life Science, as this industry demands one of the highest levels of regulatory requirements. You might find that some of the requirements are relevant to your organization despite not being within Life Science. In the following section, you will be introduced to the general purpose of validation and traceability, as well as the documents to provide and the tasks that needs to be completed to qualify the Power Platform, validate apps, and maintain the qualified or validated status.
