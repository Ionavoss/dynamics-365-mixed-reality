# Maintenance of the qualified and validated status

Once you have qualified the infrastructure (Power Platform) and validated the applications (Guides and Power Apps), it is important to oversee they are kept under control. The computer systems and infrastructure are dynamic in nature. For example, in case of new system versions and infrastructure upgrades, procedures must be in place to maintain the qualified/validated state. These changes may directly or indirectly affect product quality, patient safety, data integrity, internal policies, regulatory compliance, or business.

The qualified/validated status must be maintained by implementing internal procedures.

Procedures which should be in place:

- *Change Control*: Change control is a process which ensures that all system changes are under control and ensures and defines your implementation strategy of change.

- *Incident/Problem Management*: Incident and problem management are processes to ensure that any unplanned issues that could have impact on patient safety, product quality, and data integrity are addressed before any harm occurs. A problem relates to the root cause of one or more incidents. Problems can be raised in response to a single significant incident or multiple related incidents.

- *Corrective Action & Preventive Action*: The corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) is a process for investigating, understanding, and correcting deviations. It addresses the immediate impact of the issue and minimizes the risk of recurrence.

- *Training*: A training plan must be in place and should define relevant training according to end-user roles.

- *Continuous monitoring*: Continuous monitoring is a process to establish monitoring activities which monitor and report system failures, availability, performance, configuration baseline, and information security issues.

- *Backup and Restore*: Backup and restore is a process of saving data, records, configurations, and software to protect against loss of integrity or availability of the originals.

- *System administration*: System administration is a process which involves routine management and support of systems to ensure that they are running efficiently and effectively.

- *Periodic Review*: Periodic review is a process which ensures that outcomes from review activities confirm that all components of a system as well as the required support and maintenance processes are established and under control.

Maintenance of the qualified condition for Power Platform and the validated condition for Guides and Power Apps is an activity that occurs on an ongoing basis; adequate monitoring, documentation, and evaluation of program impacts can maintain the control condition.
