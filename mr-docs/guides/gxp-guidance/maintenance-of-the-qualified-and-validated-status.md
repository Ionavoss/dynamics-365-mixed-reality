# Maintenance of the qualified and validated status

Once you have qualified the infrastructure (the Power Platform) and validated the applications (Guides and Power Apps), it is important to oversee they are kept under control. The computer systems and infrastructure are dynamic in nature. For example, in case of new system versions and infrastructure upgrades, procedures must be in place to maintain the qualified/validated state. These changes may directly or indirectly affect product quality, patient safety, data integrity, internal policies, regulatory compliance, or business.

Qualified/validated status must be maintained by implementing internal procedures.

Here are listed procedures which should be in place:

-   *Change Control*: Change control is a process which ensures that all system changes are under control. The change control process should also ensure and define your implementation strategy of change.

-   *Incident/Problem Management*: Incident and problem management are processes to ensure that any unplanned issues that could have impact on patient safety, product quality, and data integrity are addressed before any harm occur. A problem relates to the root cause of one or more incidents. Problems can be raised in response to a single significant incident or multiple related incidents.

-   *Corrective Action & Preventive Action*: The corrective and preventive actions, also called CAPA, is a process for investigating, understanding, and correcting deviations to address the immediate impact of the issue and to minimize the risk of recurrence.

-   *Training*: A training plan must be in place and should define relevant training according to end-user roles.

-   *Continuous monitoring*: Continuous monitoring is a process to establish monitoring activities which will be used to monitor and report system failures, availability, performance, configuration baseline, and information security issues.

-   *Backup and Restore*: Backup and Restore is a process of saving data, records, configurations, and software to protect against loss of integrity or availability of the originals.

-   *System administration*: System administration is a process which involves routine management and support of systems to ensure that they are running efficiently and effectively.

-   *Periodic Review*: Periodic review is a process which ensures that outcomes from review activities confirm that all components of a system as well as the required support and maintenance processes are established and under control.

Maintenance of the qualified condition for Power Platform and the validated condition for Guides and Power Apps is an activity that occurs on an ongoing basis; adequate monitoring, documentation, and evaluation of program impacts can maintain the control condition.

## Recommendations for Organizational Change Management 

Implementing and adopting Mixed Reality in organizations requires strong orchestrating efforts. New hardware, new software, and new ways of working needs to be addressed, managed, and governed through controlled processes and well executed Organizational Change Management (OCM).

OCM is an important part of your implementation process because it helps to ensure that Guides is effectively adopted and integrated into your organization: If your operators do not take advantage of guides for training and job instruction in their daily work life at the production sites, HoloLens and Guides will provide no organizational benefits despite being technically implemented in an industry compliant way.

To foster organizational adoption and ensure buy-in from departments, managers, training consultants, operators etc., it is recommended you perform four activities inspired by [Prosci's ADKAR® model](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar):

1. **Formulate a change vision**

Make it crystal clear what the purpose of implementing Guides is and to which desired state you plan to steer your organization. This is called a change vision. On a strategic level, a change vision will help to ensure that the purpose of your Guides implementation is in line with your company's overall strategy and future goals.  
  
A generic example of a change vision statement could be: "We leverage Guides to enhance the quality and efficiency of operator training while maintaining strict compliance with industry regulations, empowering our workforce to continuously improve their skills and contribute to the success of the organization."

It is recommended to involve representatives from different organizational stakeholder groups in the change vision creation by facilitating a series of workshops. By bringing in different stakeholder perspectives, your change vision will naturally become more well-rounded. And because of their involvement, you increase the chances that stakeholders are invested in the vision, support it, and take accountability for their part in making the vision a reality.

2. **Assess site or area maturity**

When implementing Guides, it is important to assess if the production site or area in question is ready for roll-out. For this purpose, it is recommended to, among other things:

-   Establish a use case selection process to make sure that the training and job instruction processes in question are relevant to support via Guides. Tip: Processes that are complex (involving multiple steps, for instance), rare (and thereby difficult to remember), difficult (because they tend to cause deviations), and prone to frequent onboarding of new operators (e.g., due to high staff turnover) are usually relevant.

-   Make a list of local requirements needed to succeed with Guides adoption, including but not limited to the following requirements: management approval, allocated resources for adoption, finalized role distribution (for example, who will be authors?), and site acceptance of planned adoption timeline.

3. **Prepare for onboarding of areas/sites and onboard them**

When one or more sites or areas are considered mature enough for a Guides adoption, you will prepare for the actual onboarding of sites or areas. To prepare, it is recommended to:

-   Map and analyze stakeholders to identify potential roadblocks, assess the level of support or resistance to the adoption process, and tailor communication and engagement strategies to meet the needs of the specific stakeholder group.

When onboarding sites, consider to:

-   Utilize a similar onboarding plan across areas/sites with a clear division of responsibility and roles to ensure coherent and adequate onboarding.

-   Equip sites/areas with adoption and training "packages", consisting of, for instance: Guides' instructions for end-users (role-based), scripts and templates for workshops/ meetings/emails (to the local project team), and executive summaries (for local management).

-   Ensure standardized Guides training, that is continuously updated based on learnings and improvements across all sites.

-   Define and deploy a "train the trainer"-concept to scale the standardized Guides training through local "ambassadors". An important success criterion for the concept is the empowerment of frontline workers – are they capable of authoring and operating guides because of the training?

4. **Sustain adoption and secure benefit realization**

As Guides are successfully rolled out to areas and sites, you will want to ensure the continued success of the software. In this context, consider to:

-   Create a process for rolling out changes such as new software features.

-   Develop area and site KPIs to track the performance of Guides.

-   Regularly distribute user satisfaction surveys and incorporate or respond to the feedback given.
