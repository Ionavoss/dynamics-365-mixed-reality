# Applied styles

Authors add styles to provide visual cues for your holograms.

The styles available in Guides and what they mean include:

| Icon | What it means |
|---|---|
| Original | Default appearance. |
| Red flashing | Areas or things to avoid. |
| Green flashing | Areas or things to approach. |
| Yellow and black stripes | Warning about a safety or quality concern. |
| A pulse that appears through it | Things that occur inside something. |
| Outline | Something to pick up. |
| Dotted line | Where to place something. |
| 90% bright white | Sensitive objects are obscured from view. |
| 100% transparent, including objects behind it | Pass-through holograms to see the real world behind them. |
| Metallic | An object with a metallic finish. |
| 50% transparent | Seeing an object without obscuring the  view. |
| 75% transparent | Seeing an object through two layers. |
