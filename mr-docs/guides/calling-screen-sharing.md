# Screen sharing in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

When a remote export using Microsoft Teams (desktop or mobile) shares their screen with you on a call in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens, the screen automatically appears as a new window in your environment.

The live video feed of the person sharing their screen is suspended in the Meeting window in this case. The video feed and the shared screen cannot both be on at the same time.

You can use direct touch to move the shared screen around, and to size it. You can also interact with the screen by using your gaze cursor. This is particularly useful for situations where you want to move the window further away from you. 

If the video feed is switched to another person on the call, that person's video feed is displayed in the Meeting window and the shared screen is suspended.

To go back to the shared screen, select either the button that appears on the live feed or on the shared screen window.
