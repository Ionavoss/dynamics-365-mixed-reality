# View a remote expert's screen in the Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens app

When a remote export using Microsoft Teams (desktop or mobile) shares their screen with you on a call in Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens, the screen automatically appears as a new window in your environment.

The live video feed of the person sharing their screen is suspended in the Meeting window in this case. The video feed and the shared screen cannot both be on at the same time.

You can use direct touch to move the shared screen around, and to size it. You can also interact with the screen by using your gaze cursor. This is particularly useful for situations where you want to move the window further away from you. 

If the video feed is switched to another person on the call while a screen is being shared, that person's video feed is displayed in the Meeting window and the shared screen is suspended (turns gray). A button appears on the suspended screen that you can select to make the shared screen active again.

You can also make the shared screen active again by selecting a similar button in the live video feed in the Meeting window.

If you make the shared screen active by using either of these buttons, the video feed for the person displayed in the Meeting window is suspended again. 

If the person who shared their screen stops sharing, the shared screen disappears, and the video feed for the person sharing their screen appears in the Meeting window again.
