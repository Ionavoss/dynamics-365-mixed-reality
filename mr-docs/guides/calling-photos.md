# Capture and share photos

HoloLens users can take photos and share photos during a call or meeting.

## Take a photo

You can take a photo of your mixed reality annotations during a call or take a photo of a piece of equipment to share. For example, send a photo to your remote collaborators so that they can clearly see an intricate part of the machine or a machine tag with small characters. You can take a photo at any time with the HoloLens, even when Guides is closed.

To take a picture of your current view in the HoloLens, press the volume up and volume down buttons on your HoloLens at the same time (or say, "Take a picture” or “Take a photo”). The photo is saved to the device. For more information, see [Capture a mixed reality photo](/hololens/holographic-photos-and-videos#capture-a-mixed-reality-photo).

## Share photos

HoloLens users can share photos from the HoloLens device during a call or meeting directly within chat.

1. While [on a call](calling-start-call.md) or meeting, select the **Chat** button.

   A new Chat window appears to the right of the video feed.

1. In the message window, select the **Gallery** icon. The images from your device display.

1. Use the scroll up and down arrows to scroll through your images. Select the images you want to share, up to 6, and then select **Next**. The selected files are uploaded.

After the files are uploaded, a sent message displays and the photos are shared in the chat with others on the call.

> [!TIP]
> All call participants at the time the photos are shared have read permission. Participants joining later may not be able to access the photos. If they can’t access the photos, they are prompted to request permission to gain access to the photos.
