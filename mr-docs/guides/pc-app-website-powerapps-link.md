# Add a website, email, guide, or an app link to a step

You can add a website link, email, guide, custom app, or a Power Apps link to a Step card in Dynamics 365 Guides creating a seamless workflow for operators. Configure an action link with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme so when an operator activates the link, the HoloLens opens the corresponding app or page.

- [**Link.**](#add-a-link-to-a-step) Add a link to a step so that operators can see and interact with information outside the particular guide. For example, connect a sequence of guides, launch a website, launch a page of the Settings app, or launch a custom app that has been installed on the device.

- [**Power Apps link.**](#add-a-power-apps-link-to-a-step) Add a Power Apps link to a step. [Power Apps](https://products.office.com/business/microsoft-powerapps) enables teams to create custom applications with low-code tools to solve unique business workflows. By combining Guides and Power Apps, you can extend Guides capabilities to create a more seamless end-to-end solution that fits the needs of your operators. For example, you can add a link to an interactive quiz app, a parts re-ordering app, or an app that provides the latest status on IoT sensors.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > To run Power Apps from Guides, operators need a [Power Apps license](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/). They must also have [permission](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app#share-an-app) to view the app that is created in Power Apps.

## Add a link to a step

To add a link to a step, you add an action. You can add one action per step. If a step already includes an action, any new action that you add overwrites the existing action.

1. On the right side of the page, select the **Action** tab.

1. Drag the **Link** circle to the **Action** circle in the lower-right corner of the **Step Editor** pane.

1. In the **Link** dialog box that appears, enter the corresponding information based on the selected action:

   - Email: Enter **mailto:** and the email address.
   - Guide or step: [Create and copy a link to a guide or step](pc-app-copy-link-guide-step.md).
   - Web page: Enter the web address starting with **http:** or **https:**.
   - A HoloLens settings page: Enter **ms-settings:{[URI](/hololens/settings-uri-list#settings-uris)}**, for example **ms-settings:bluetooth** to open the Bluetooth settings.
   - A custom app: Enter the [registered URI](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/handle-uri-activation) in the format expected by the app.

     > [!NOTE]
     > If a custom app has been registered as the [default handler for a URI](/windows/uwp/launch-resume/handle-uri-activation), an author can launch that app by specifying a URI in the format expected by the app. Apps can be launched in [kiosk mode](/hololens/hololens-kiosk). Administrators can [use WDAC and Windows PowerShell to allow or block apps on HoloLens 2 devices with Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/custom-profile-hololens).

1. Select **Save**.

1. To view, edit, or delete the link, right-click the **Link** button in the **Step Editor** pane, and then select the appropriate command.
