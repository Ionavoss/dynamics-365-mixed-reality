# Protect company information by restricting capabilities in Dynamics 365 Guides

In some cases, to protect company information, you might want to restrict capabilities in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Guides. For example, you might provide HoloLens devices installed with Dynamics 365 Guides to other businesses as part of your customer support system. You don't want these users to have access to your company information, but you do want them to be able to join meetings and receive meeting notifications so they can troubleshoot issues. To restrict calling and restrict access to contacts and files, see the following information:

- [Restrict calling and the ability to search and access contacts](restricted-mode-calling.md)

- [Restrict the ability to access OneDrive files](restricted-mode-files.md)

- [Restrict the ability to sign out of the HoloLens app](restricted-mode-signout.md)
