# Join a meeting or live event on Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens

You can join a Microsoft Teams meeting or Microsoft Teams live event by using Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens. A [Microsoft Teams meeting](/microsoftteams/quick-start-meetings-live-events) is a meeting **scheduled** with Teams that includes any number of participants. A [Microsoft Teams live event](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events) is an extension of a Teams meeting used to broadcast video and meeting content to a large online audience. A Microsoft Teams live event is useful for one-to-many communications where the host of the event is leading the interactions and audience participation is primarily limited to viewing the content shared by the host. A Dynamics 365 Guides HoloLens user can join a live event as a presenter or attendee in the same way that they join a meeting.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> To join a meeting from Dynamics 365 Guides on HoloLens, you must have an Exchange Online license (not Exchange on-premises).

If a participant wants to join the meeting, but they're not part of your organization, a notification appears at the top of the screen to let you know that the participant is waiting in the Lobby and a **Participants button** with a red dot (showing action required) appears at the bottom-right corner of the screen.

> [!NOTE]
> The meeting organizer can decide who is admitted into a meeting directly and who has to wait for someone to admit them.

> Dynamics 365 Guides users might not be able to join scheduled meetings between different companies if link-rewriting (URL-rewriting services) are used to fight spam. To make sure that users can join scheduled meetings in this situation, add an exception so that links from teams.microsoft.com are not rewritten.
