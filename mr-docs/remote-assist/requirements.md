# Technical requirements for deploying and using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist

This article describes the technical requirements for deploying and using Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist.

## Definitions

**Dynamics 365 Remote Assist user:** Someone who uses the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app on HoloLens or mobile devices.

**Teams user:** Someone who uses the Teams app on the desktop or mobile devices.

## Device requirements

Both Dynamics 365 Remote Assist users and Teams users can join a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call. [Learn more about the different types of calls](./mobile-app/making-calls-on-remote-assist-mobile.md).

The Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app is available on HoloLens, HoloLens 2, and qualifying AndroidÂ or iOS mobile devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Android devices that have a time-of-flight (ToF) sensor and support the [Depth API](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices) and iOS devices that have a LiDAR sensor [(see LiDAR sensor in the tables listed for iOS and iPadOS devices)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iOS_and_iPadOS_devices) are likely to have better accuracy with annotation placement.

If an individual wants to join a Dynamics 365 Remote Assist call using the Teams app, they must use the Teams app on Windows, Mac, or mobile.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on a non-Windows device, the operating system of the device processes some personal data to enable push and incoming call notifications. Microsoft may, accordingly, send data to the external, third-party notification services so users can see who is calling or be notified of a chat message. Google Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and Apple Push Notification services are not provisioned in a dedicated data center for exclusive use by you and are governed by their own service-specific terms and privacy statements, which you should carefully review.

## Licensing and product requirements per role

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app user

A Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license includes the following three products needed to use most features available in the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens app, mobile app, or web app:

* Dynamics 365 Remote Assist 
* Microsoft Teams
* Microsoft Dataverse

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamics 365 Remote Assist [supports a subset of Microsoft Teams policies](teams-policies.md). 

| **Included with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist license** | **What capabilities are available?**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Teams**             | Use calling features via the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app on HoloLens or mobile devices. Features include: </br> - Make a call </br> - Use mixed-reality annotations                                            |

### Administrator

[Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) account to assign licenses in Microsoft 365 admin portal and distribute applications through Microsoft Store for Business. [Learn more about how to deploy Dynamics 365 Remote Assist](deploy-remote-assist.md).

## Network requirements

A variety of network conditions, including bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss, can impact your video calling experience. Although audio and video calls might be possible in environments with reduced bandwidth, you might experience feature degradation.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile

When using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on mobile devices, a minimum of 1.5 Mbps up/down is required for peer-to-peer HD quality video calling with resolution of HD 720p at 15fps.

If Dynamics 365 Remote Assist mobile autodetects that the technician is experiencing [poor network conditions](./mobile-app/poor-network-connectivity.md#poor-network-connectivity-is-determined-by-the-following-conditions), it will prompt the technician to share high-quality snapshots instead of transmitting a low-quality live video feed. See [Calls in low bandwidth](mobile-app/poor-network-connectivity.md) for more information.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist HoloLens

When using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens, a minimum of 1.5 Mbps up/down is required for peer-to-peer HD-quality video calling with resolution of HD 1080p at 30 fps. In general, when more bandwidth is available, quality and usage will increase to deliver the best experience. For **optimal** peer-to-peer HD-quality video calling with resolution of HD 1080p, 4-5 Mbps up/down is required. However, in some circumstances, even 4-5 Mbps up/down does not guarantee 1080p video calling at full quality. Circumstances include using HoloLens (first gen).

### URLs and ports
The list below contains the *minimum* URL end points and TCP/UDP ports utilized by Dynamics 365 Remote Assist. All must be reachable from the Dynamics 365 Remote Assist app. If you have specialized needs and/or scale, see the [Teams comprehensive list](/microsoftteams/prepare-network) for specifics.

> [!NOTE]
> US Government Community Cloud (GCC) environments require additional URLs to be added to the allowlist. For more information, see the following topics:

### Network optimization recommendations

The following tasks serve as a checklist for other potential optimizations for Dynamics 365 Remote Assist:

- [Monitor your network using CQD and call analytics](/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#best-practice-monitor-your-network-using-cqd-and-call-analytics).
- Review Teams' recommendations [for optimizing your network](/MicrosoftTeams/prepare-network#network-optimization).
- Be on a dedicated SSID. The dedicated SSID should be on the 5-Ghz band only; disable 2.4 Ghz.
- Use a router with MU-MIMO capabilities.

### Additional resources

- Learn how to troubleshoot and address internal infrastructure issues usingÂ [Teams Call Analytics](/MicrosoftTeams/use-call-analytics-to-troubleshoot-poor-call-quality#troubleshoot-call-quality-problems-using-call-analytics) orÂ [Teams Call Quality Dashboard (CQD)](/MicrosoftTeams/quality-of-experience-review-guide).
