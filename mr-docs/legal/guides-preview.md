# MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS<br>MICROSOFT DYNAMICS 365 GUIDES PREVIEW 
 
These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They apply to the Preview 
software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (the “Preview”) (except to the extent such services or updates 
are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or 
Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. 

**1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.**

> **a) General.** You may install and run one instance of the software on Windows devices you own or control in order to access and 
interact with the software. Your access and use of this software must comply with these terms. You must uninstall the software 
after the trial period ends unless you have purchased a subscription covering the device on which the software is installed. 

> **b) Limitations and Exclusions.** The Microsoft Online Services Terms (see [http://microsoftvolumelicensing.com/](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter)) and any Microsoft 
volume licensing agreement you have entered into with Microsoft, or any other applicable agreement (collectively, the “Microsoft 
Licensing Agreement” or “MLA”), and any references or statements made in the Trust Center do not apply to the Preview, including, 
but not limited to, data security, GDPR, and professional services related terms. Microsoft also may, in its sole discretion, 
limit the: (a) rate at which the Preview may be called or made available; and (b) the amount of data that may be uploaded to, 
or served from, the Preview (all of the foregoing being forms of "Throttling"). Microsoft may perform this Throttling globally 
across the Preview. You will not take steps to circumvent or disable any technical measures Microsoft may put in place to enforce 
Throttling. The Preview is subject to reduced or different security, compliance and privacy commitments. Any data provided to 
Microsoft through your use of the software and the Preview may be transferred, stored, and processed in the United States, 
or in any other country where Microsoft of its subcontractors operate.  

>> **Important**

>> If you are the administrator for the organization and have authority to act on behalf of and to bind the organization, then by 
installing or using the Preview, you consent to allow authorized users of Microsoft Dynamics 365 online services to activate, 
configure and enable certain functionality which transmits Customer Data (as defined in the MLA) to external systems. Please 
consult the feature technical documentation available in [Overview of Dynamics 365 Guides](../guides/index.md)(.

> **c) Required Microsoft Applications.** The software requires a license to Microsoft Dynamics 365 CDS and Microsoft Power BI Pro and a 
preview license to access and use such applications may be available to you in connection with this Preview. These license terms 
apply to those applications, unless other license terms are provided with your preview or paid subscription to such other Microsoft 
applications, in which case those other terms govern. Some functionality may require additional licenses for other Microsoft 
software or applications. You will not be able to use this functionality unless you have a separate license for such Microsoft 
software or application. 

**2. TIME-LIMITED SUBSCRIPTION.** 

> **a) Period.** Unless Microsoft extends the term by notice in writing, this agreement is effective on your acceptance and terminates 
on the earlier of (i) 30 days following first availability of a commercial release of the software or (ii) upon termination 
of this agreement by Microsoft. Microsoft may extend this agreement in its discretion.

> **b) Access to data.** You may not be able to access data used in the software when the preview term ends.

**3. DATA COLLECTION.** The software may collect information about you and your use of the software and send that to Microsoft. 
Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve Microsoft’s products and services. Your opt-out rights, 
if any, are described in the product documentation. Some features in the software may enable collection of data from users of 
your applications that access or use the software. If you use these features to enable data collection in your applications, you 
must comply with applicable law, including getting any required user consent, and maintain a prominent privacy policy that accurately 
informs users about how you use, collect, and share their data. You can learn more about Microsoft’s data collection and use in the 
product documentation and the Microsoft Privacy Statement at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). You agree to comply with 
all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement. 

**4. DATA TRANSFERS.** Customer Data and Personal Data (as defined in the MLA) that Microsoft processes on your behalf may be 
transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its subprocessors operate. 
You appoint Microsoft to perform any such transfer of Customer Data and Personal Data to any such country and to store and process 
Customer Data and Personal Data to provide the Preview. Microsoft will abide by the requirements of European Economic Area and Swiss 
data protection law regarding the collection, use, transfer, retention, and other processing of Personal Data from the European Economic Area and Switzerland. All transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization will be subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR ((EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of Personal Data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC) and such transfers and safeguards will be documented according to Article 30(2) of the GDPR. In addition, Microsoft is certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks and the commitments they entail. Microsoft agrees to notify you if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield principles. 

**5. SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights 
despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to): 

> a) work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways; 

> b) reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software; 

> c) remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

> d) use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or

> e) share, publish, distribute, or lend the software, provide the software as a stand-alone hosted solution for others to use, 
or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

**6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, 
which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, 
visit [https://aka.ms/exporting](https://aka.ms/exporting). 

**7. SUPPORT SERVICES.** Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to provide any support services for the software. Any support 
provided is “as is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind and Microsoft may cease providing support (if any) at any time,
without notice. If Microsoft elects to provide support, Microsoft will solely own any enhancements or improvements to the Preview 
arising from provision of such support services. 

**8. UPDATES.** The software may periodically check for updates, and download and install them for you. You may obtain updates only from 
Microsoft or authorized sources. Microsoft may need to update your system to provide you with updates. You agree to receive these 
automatic updates without any additional notice. Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, 
or peripheral devices. 

**9. FEEDBACK.** “Feedback” is all suggestions, comments, input, ideas, or know-how, in any form, that you provide to Microsoft about 
the Preview. If you give Feedback to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize 
your Feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give Feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to 
license its software or documentation to third parties because Microsoft includes your Feedback in them. These rights survive this 
agreement. 

**10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, 
is the entire agreement for the software. 

**11. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.** If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the 
state or province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is located) govern the interpretation 
of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), 
regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal 
jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court in King County, Washington 
for all disputes heard in court. If not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King 
County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. 

**12. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including 
consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, 
you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those 
other rights if the laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software 
in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you: 

> **a) Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to 
affect those rights.

> **b) Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, 
disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume 
checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how 
to turn off updates for your specific device or software. 

> **c) Germany and Austria.** 

>> **i.Warranty.** The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany 
the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software. 

>> **ii.Limitation of Liability.** In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, 
in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.

>>Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such 
material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of 
which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called 
"cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence. 

**13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, 
GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.**

**14. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, 
YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, 
INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.** 

>**This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, 
or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, 
or other tort; or any other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.** 

>**It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or 
exclusion may not apply to you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, 
consequential, or other damages.**

droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon 
sont exclues.** 

**LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses 
fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune
